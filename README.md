# QFlow

Welcome to **QFlow**, we focus on advancing Research And Development on Reinforcement Learning (RL) for LLMs. At **QFlow**, we don’t just apply traditional RL techniques to LLMs—we’ve crafted a dedicated toolbox packed with innovative solutions to help you unlock the full potential of reinforcement learning.

## What is QFlow?

**QFlow** is an RL framework designed to make fine-tuning and optimizing large language models more efficient and creative. We blend the power of **Q-values** with cutting-edge RL techniques to deliver a seamless learning experience that drives better performance in language models.

### What makes QFlow different?

While traditional reinforcement learning focuses on learning optimal actions through trial and error, **QFlow** introduces a unique methodology specifically tailored to the nuances of language models. We provide a toolbox with solutions that bring efficiency, creativity, and adaptability to RL applications for LLMs.

## Features

- **Dedicated Toolbox**: A set of tools designed to handle reinforcement learning challenges specific to LLMs.
- **Creative Solutions**: Breakthrough techniques and methodologies that make training language models faster, smarter, and more efficient.
- **Scalable Performance**: Optimize LLMs with algorithms like **PPO**, **DPO**, and **GRPO**—designed for the unique needs of NLP tasks.
- **Flow of Q-Values**: Keep track of how Q-values evolve throughout the training process, making the optimization smoother and more intuitive.

## Available RL Algorithms

QFlow supports several powerful RL algorithms that can be used to fine-tune your large language models. Choose the one that fits your training requirements:

- [x] **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**
- [x] **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)**
- [x] **Generalized Policy Gradient Optimization (GRPO)**
