# QFlow

Welcome to **QFlow**, we focus on advancing Research And Development on Reinforcement Learning (RL) for LLMs. At **QFlow**, we give Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Models the special treatment that it deserves. We dig deep into the first principles of Reinforcement Learning reimaginining the entire spectrum creating interesting and creative possibilities. 
## What is QFlow?

**QFlow** is an RL framework designed to make fine-tuning and optimizing large language models more efficient and creative. 

### What makes QFlow different?

While traditional reinforcement learning focuses on learning optimal actions through trial and error, **QFlow** introduces a unique methodology specifically tailored to the nuances of language models. We provide a toolbox with solutions that bring efficiency, creativity, and adaptability to RL applications for LLMs.


## Installation

To get started with **QFlow**, simply clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Raj-08/QFlow.git
cd QFlow
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Features

- **Dedicated Toolbox**: A set of tools designed to handle reinforcement learning challenges specific to LLMs.
- **Creative Solutions**: Breakthrough techniques and methodologies that make training language models faster, smarter, and more efficient.
- **Scalable Performance**: Optimize LLMs with algorithms like **PPO**, **DPO**, and **GRPO**â€”designed for the unique needs of the LLM world.
- **Hyperparameter Search**: We use Evolutionary Algorithms to find the right configuration of hyperparametrs to make our trainings more effective.

## Available RL Algorithms

QFlow supports several powerful RL algorithms that can be used to fine-tune your large language models. Choose the one that fits your training requirements:

- [x] **Reinforce-Lite** (Displays Emergence while being computationally affordable)
